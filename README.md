## Get to Know the Author
**Spencer Grey**
is a native New Yorker who started making games by typing in source code from magazines (that used to be a thing!). He is a former Creative Director (Digital) of Sesame Workshop where he would boss around Elmo and Big Bird. After that, he co-founded Electric Funstuff and for 15 years developed game ideas for companies like Scholastic, Sony, and Lego. Spencer Grey is definitely not related to the grey aliens stored in Area 51. Definitely not. No way.
